# bitmap-fonts
Some bitmap font experiments, mainly in size 8x8, 8x16, 16x8 and 16x16 pixel.
Also I will provide c64 prg for direct use.
Maybe multicolor and larger sized fonts in the near future.

I for myself use this fonts for NES / SNES console dev, c64 and pico8. 
The license is MIT, so do with it, whatever you want to do. 
Perhaps another folder with c64 prg next time.

happy hacking,
